# HackerRank.CSharp
This is a Visual Studio project containing C# solutions I've written for various HackerRank challenges. I initially created it just so I could leverage a robust editor for coding and testing against more complex challenges. Then I figured might as well version-control it, as well as put it up on GitHub as a portfolio of my code. It's also a good real-world-ish practice for becoming acquainted with GitHub.

Over time I will be adding  solutions to new challenges that I solve, as well as gradually retroactively adding solutions to other challenges I've previously completed already. The solutions will typically contain minimal comments just to break down a complex algorithm into smaller components or clarify some logic that is not otherwise evident without description. Eventually I will go back and properly comment them for more public consumption and IntelliSense support when I can. I may also do some refactoring to make the solutions more SOLID.
